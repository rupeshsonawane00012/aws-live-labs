# Static Website Hosting on AWS EC2 using Nginx

## About this Practical
In this practical, I hosted a static website on an AWS EC2 instance using the Nginx web server.  
I launched an EC2 instance, installed Nginx, deployed my HTML file, and accessed the website using the public IP of the instance.

## Steps I Followed

### 1. Launched EC2 Instance
- I launched an EC2 instance using Amazon Ubuntu.
- Instance type: t3.micro (Free Tier).
- I allowed SSH (22) and HTTP (80) in the security group.


---

### 2. Connected to EC2
I connected to the instance using SSH from my local machine.

```bash
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>

###3. Installed Nginx

After connecting to the instance, I installed Nginx using the package manager.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y


Then I started and enabled the Nginx service.

sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

#$$4. Deployed the Website

I navigated to the Nginx web root directory.

I created an index.html file for my static website.

cd /var/www/html
sudo nano index.html

##Verified the Website

I opened the browser and entered the public IP address of the EC2 instance.

The static website was successfully displayed using Nginx.
