#Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an AWS Classic Load Balancer (CLB) to distribute incoming HTTP traffic across three EC2 instances, providing high availability and fault tolerance.

#Key Concepts Covered
Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
Instance-level load balancing
Health checks
High availability
EC2 User Data automation

#⚙️ Implementation Steps (FIXED & CLEAR)
1️⃣ Launch THREE EC2 Instances
Launch 3 EC2 instances with the same configuration.
Common configuration:
AMI: Ubuntu / Amazon Linux
Instance type: t2.micro
Network: Same VPC
Subnet: Public subnet
Auto-assign public IP: Enabled
Security Group:
HTTP (80) → 0.0.0.0/0
SSH (22) → Your IP

2️⃣ Configure Web Server Using User Data
Use the same user data script for all 3 instances:

#!/bin/bash
apt update -y
apt install nginx -y
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
echo "this is test server $HOSTNAME" > /var/www/html/index.html


This ensures:
Nginx installs automatically
Each instance shows its unique hostname

3️⃣ Verify EC2 Instances
Confirm all 3 EC2 instances are running
Access each instance via its public IP
You should see different hostnames on each instance

4️⃣ Create Classic Load Balancer

Load Balancer type: Classic Load Balancer
Listener: HTTP (80)
Availability Zones: Select AZs where EC2s are running
Register all 3 EC2 instances
Enable health checks

5️⃣ Test Load Balancing
Open the CLB DNS name in browser
Refresh the page multiple times
Observe responses rotating between 3 different hostnames
✔ Confirms load balancing is working.

#Health Check Validation
Navigate to Load Balancer → Instances
All 3 instances should show InService
Stop one EC2 → traffic rotates between remaining instances
Restart → instance returns to service

#Cleanup

Delete Classic Load Balancer
Terminate all 3 EC2 instances
Verify no unused Elastic IPs
